{"name":"Slugtastic","tagline":"A simple slug generator for Rails.","body":"# Slugtastic\r\n\r\nSimple gem for autogenerating permalink style slugs for your ActiveRecord models.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.9.2 or 1.9.3\r\n* Rails 3.1 or higher.\r\n\r\nIt should work with Rails 3.0 but it hasn't been tested.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'slugtastic'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install slugtastic\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUsage is very simple. Just add the following to your model:\r\n\r\n    has_slug :slug, :from => :title\r\n\r\nThis will generate a slug string from the title atrribute and store it in the slug attribute unless the slug already contains a string. The slug is generated pre-validation so you can still use `validates_presence_of :slug`.\r\n\r\nThere are no extra options at present.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
